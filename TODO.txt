-Consistent nomenclature (image instead of picture or photo? Use photo since this is a "photo" gallery, even though we're not constrained to photographs?)
--Use iamge
-Figure out best way to store test content
-Show a default picture if something goes wrong
-Add support for img srcset -- seems like a better idea
-Statistics on which photo resolutions get downloaded the most
--Maybe piggyback off of existing analytics?

Things to do if the idea works
-Clean up requirements.txt
-front end code to manually specify a quality level
-Configurable thumbnail size?

UI:
-index.html shows all albums
-Logging in can:
--Expose an admin console
--Expose certain pictures

Wishlist:
-Configurable logging in config.py
-Ability to change username and password without editing config.py
-Albums should have a user-editable visible attribute
-Pictures should also have a visible attribute, only set after all transcodes complete
-Ability to edit picture descriptions/captions
-Ability to delete picture from album
-Don't print a caption if it is "None"
